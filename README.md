This is the repository where we are going to learn bash and would like to automate our project.


Also I'll give names as 00 , 01 ,02 ,03 to indicate the sequence to learn.


Few of the git commands that we would use during our upcoming journey

1) git clone repoName : Download the whole repository
2) git pull : Download only the changes
3) git add fileName : Git will start tracking the you're making on the file named fileName
4) git commig -m "msg Name" : Adding Msg to the commit / changes that you made .
5) git push : Your changes will be pushed to the repo.


PS: Ensure you are inside the repo to executre the git commands ; We will perform clone once and pull multiple times
